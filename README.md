# uGet

uGet is a developing educational website aimed for university students who would like to get the best grades in their university courses. It is a place where instructors and students may interact, have online classes, and share materials such as past examns, homeworks, projects, etc. 

This website is inspired on Udemy, Nootas and Quieroapuntes trying to get the best of each of them with a personal flavor for online classes. I am trying to implement the online classes through streaming services, however I find it difficult as heroku blocks some of the ports for streaming. I will be tackling this usse in the near future.

There is still a lot to work on, like responsiveness, so please be patient as I am working on it.
