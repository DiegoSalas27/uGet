# uGet

uGet is a developing educational website aimed for university students who would like to get the best grades in their university courses. It is a place where instructors and students may interact, have online classes, and share materials such as past examns, homeworks, projects, etc. 

This website is inspired on Udemy, Nootas and Quieroapuntes trying to get the best of each of them with a personal flavor for online classes. 

There is still a lot to work on, like responsiveness, so please be patient as I am working on it.
